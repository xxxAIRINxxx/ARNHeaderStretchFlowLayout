pod-template
============

An opinionated template for creating a Pod with the following features:

- Git as the source control management system.
- Clean folder structure.
- Project generation
- MIT license.
- Testing as a standard
- Turnkey access to Travis CI

## Getting started

There are two reasons for wanting to work on this template, making your own or improving the one for everyone's. In both cases you will want to work with the ruby classes inside the `setup` folder, and the example base template that it works on from inside `template/ios/`. 

## Best practices

The CocoaPods one aims to be congruent with this guide: http://guides.cocoapods.org/making/using-pod-lib-create.html so any changes of flow should be updated there also.

## Requirements:

- CocoaPods 0.31
